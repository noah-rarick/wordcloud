## Wordcloud Activity

I wanted to explore the presidential race and search for recent youtube videos following the election front runners Donald Trump and President Biden.

I searched using the terms "trump latest news" and "biden latest news" to get recent events following the two politicians.

I wanted to make this comparison to show how the youtube algorithm might associate the two given recent events and the upcoming race. I thought this search query might be a pretty reasonable search for the average American looking for more information on either party candidate.

A lot of terms were pretty similar among the two word clouds. Both mentioned Biden and Trump which makes sense given the presidential race. I think the most notable difference was that a large word within Trump's word cloud was "defamation" and "verdict". Similarly, Biden also had words like Wisconsin and border in his word cloud due to recent events.

I think that these words came up because of Trumps recent defamation suit that he was found guilty in in, requiring a large payout. Biden also passed a new infrastructure bill focused on Wisconsin, and is also coming to an agreement with Republicans over a border bill.

In the future, I think it would be helpful to manually filter the videos to only the last week, to get a gauge of only the most recent media.

The results are pretty similar to what I expected honestly, so I am not that surprised with the wordclouds. However with some of the words I definitely made sure to look them up to see what might be causing higher frequency of more odd words, which made me more informed on recent events.
